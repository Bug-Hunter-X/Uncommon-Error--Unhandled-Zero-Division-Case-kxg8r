This repository demonstrates a subtle error in Python code where a function fails to handle an uncommon edge case. The function `function_with_uncommon_error` attempts to divide two numbers, but does not consider the scenario where both inputs are zero. This results in an unhandled division by zero error. The solution file provides a corrected version of the function that includes the missing case in the if/elif condition. This showcases the importance of thorough edge case testing and handling for robustness.
